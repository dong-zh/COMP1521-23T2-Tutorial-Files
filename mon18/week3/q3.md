# Question 3

## Write MIPS directives to represent the following C variables (if you were asked to put them in the data segment)

## `int u`

```mips
    .space 4
    # 4 means 4 bytes of space
    # We can't use .word because we don't know what to initialise it to
```

## `int v = 42`

```mips
    .word 42
    # We use .word because we know what to initialise the int to
```

## `char w`

```mips
    .space 1
    # .space again because we don't know what to initialise it to
```



## `char x = 'a'`

```mips
    .byte 'a'
```


## `double y`

```mips
    .space 8
```


## `int z[20]`

```mips
    .space 80
    # 20 * 4 (20 of 4 byte integer)
```
