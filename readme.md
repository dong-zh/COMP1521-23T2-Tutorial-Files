# COMP1521 23T2 Tutorial Files

Please cross reference the lecture notes as I may have added things here and there to show things working/not working.

If you see a mistake, please let me know with dongzhu.huang@unsw.edu.au.

Each week might have its own `readme.md` with a short summary of that week's topic. Those `readme`s don't cover every examinable topic, so please revise the lectures as well.
